## polyglots
/* glot.py *

If you run ``python glot.py -blank`` a text file is created called paulie.txt 

However, if you open this text file with a pdf viewer, 
it's also able to be viewed as a blank pdf (and a 
pauli.pdf is generated). 

In a different sense of polyglotiness, running ``python glot.py -latex`` 
creates a little pdf file, which also contains a link that you can click to
see a video in your browser.
